# Coffee Machine

**Coffee Machine** is an innovative web application that lets you order your favorite coffee with just a few simple input parameters, such as the type of drink, the amount of money you have, the number of sugars you prefer, and whether you want your drink extra hot. The application not only serves your coffee but also provides a delightful message related to your chosen drink.

## How it Works

The **Coffee Machine** application consists of two key components:

### API (Express, Mongoose, MongoClient)

The API serves as the heart of the application. It encapsulates the essential business logic and, upon receiving the user's input parameters, returns the desired coffee or informs the user about any issues with the order.

### Web App (React)

The user interacts with the application through a user-friendly React web page. Here, you can easily input the parameters for your coffee order, including the drink type, the amount of money you have, the number of sugars, and whether you want your coffee extra hot. Please note that the page does not perform input validation.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.

For the backend (API):

1. Navigate to the backend directory.
2. Install the required Node.js packages by running:

For the frontend (React web app):

2. Install the required Node.js packages by running:
